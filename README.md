# Arbgeom_rs
This was a prototype I made to work out the fundamental idea behind the [arbgeom game](https://tomwol.itch.io/arbgeom).

A lot has changed in the arbgeom game since this, the geometry/manifold builder is an example of this.  I am planning on opensourcing the current geometry builder when fully implemented, so people will be able to create their own levels for arbgeom with docs.
